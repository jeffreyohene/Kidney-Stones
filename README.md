Kidney Stones and The Simpson's Paradox


In this project, I will work with medical data published in 1986 in "The British Medical Journal" where the effectiveness of two types of kidney stone removal treatments (A - open surgery and B - percutaneous nephrolithotomy) were compared.

I will use multiple logistic regression and visualize model output to help the doctors determine if there is a difference between the two treatments. 

The dataset used in this project is simulated based on the original medical paper published here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1339981/
